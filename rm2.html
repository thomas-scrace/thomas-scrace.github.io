    <h1>Thoughts on the reMarkable 2</h1>

    6 Jan 2021

    <h2>Hardware</h2>

    <p>
    The device is very well made and feels great in the hand. It's very
    thin. It feels like the future. I did not get the case, and I do not
    recommend getting the case. It feels great in its unprotected form and
    I don't think it needs much protection.

    <p>
    There is no logo printed on the front of the device, which I like, but
    it does show the logo on the screen when sleeping or turned off.

    <p>
    It has a single hardware button, which is used for powering on/off and
    sleeping.

    <p>
    The stylus attaches to the left-hand side of the device using magnets.
    The magnets are strong enough that you can hold the device up just by the
    stylus and it will not fall off. It snaps into place nicely without too
    much faffing.

    <p>
    The stylus does not require charging.

    <h2>Battery</h2>

    <p>
    I have found that the battery depletes quite rapidly under moderately
    heavy use, which surprised me. If you are taking notes all day and using
    it for reading too, be prepared to charge it every 2 or 3 days.
    I suspect it's the writing rather than the reading that eats battery the
    fastest, but I have not tested this.

    <h2>Cloud sync</h2>

    <p>
    It has cloud sync. That is, you can get an app for your phone that allows
    you to add documents to the device and it will copy them over. You can
    also get a Chrome extension that lets you save web pages to the device.
    This works quite nicely and the resulting documents are very pleasant to
    read. However, the sync process seems a bit fragile and sometimes takes
    a significant amount of time for a shared file or page to appear on the
    device. There is no way to force it to refresh, which can be
    a frustration.

    <p>
    Doing more fancy things like syncing your Pocket or Instapaper list to
    the device is theoretically possible with a lot of faffing about, but
    I wouldn't count on it. It's not supported officially. Which brings me
    to...


    <h2>Hackability</h2>

    <p>
    You can ssh to the device and get root. So, in theory you can do pretty
    much whatever you want. There is also an API for the cloud sync which
    I think somebody has reverse engineered. There is a community of people
    writing software of various sorts for it. However, I have found most of
    it to be pretty immature and not particularly robust or practical.
    Hopefully this will get better over time. For now, expect a lot of
    faffery if you want to go far off the beaten path.


    <h2>Writing</h2>

    <p>
    It has the best digital writing experience I am aware of. It has
    slightly more latency than the iPad under certain circumstances. But in
    general the texture of the writing surface is far superior to writing on
    glass. It is easy to forget sometimes that you are not writing on paper.

    <p>
    It does have the ability to convert handwriting to text. In general this
    works pretty well, but is not perfect.

    <p>
    I got the "plus" stylus, which has an eraser built into it like a pencil.
    I do not recommend it. It's actually much easier just to use the normal
    eraser tools built into the software.

    <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>
    The physical reading experience is really nice. It's very pleasant to
    read papers and web pages on a large comfortable e-ink display. However,
    the software for reading is a bit primitive compared with things like
    the Kindle. Reading PDFs is ok, but the zoom functionality is a bit
    clunky, and it can be hard to get it to the perfect zoom level. Ebooks
    are better since they automatically reflow the text to fit.

    <p>
    There is no ability to select words and get definitions, which is
    a major let-down for any e-reader. You can mark up documents and
    highlight with the stylus, which is really fun.

    <p>
    Overall the reading experience is good but let down by feature-poor
    reading software. Hopefully this will improve with time.
